Project: to see if any data points are statistically significant in predicting interstitial fluids

Non-invasive blood glucose / interstitial fluids predictor (if any x variables are statistically significant)

Project issues: I don't have any electrical spectroscopy to measure wrist data (I used apple and fitbit watches for heart rate)

## if you want to help; please reach out; I am looking for other variables/devices to test on ~ electrical signals on wrist would be ideal

Measure these with interstitial fluids of Medtronic 780G pump > document data in spreadsheet > run predictive analysis equations

Model(s) used: multivariate linear regression, ridge regression, polynomial regression, lasso regression, elastic net regression; Adjusted R-squared:; 

No variables show statistical significance as of today; p value < .05

Since no variables show significance, I use the average of all the models used to predict blood glucose/interstitial fluids.
