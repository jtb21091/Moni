Project: to see if any data points are statistically significant in predicting interstitial fluids

Non-invasive blood glucose / interstitial fluids predictor (if any x variables are statistically significant)

Project issues: I don't have any electrical spectroscopy to measure wrist data (I used apple and fitbit watches for heart rate)

## if you want to help; please reach out; I am looking for other variables/devices to test on ~ electrical signals on wrist would be ideal
